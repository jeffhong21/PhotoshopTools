Install PhotoshopCC2015 Extensions 

Download the zip file and unzip it.

OSX

Copy the folder to 
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/

Copy the unzipped folder into the extensions folder.

Windows

Copy the unzipped folder to the appropriate directory.
Windows 64: C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions\
Windows 32: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions\
If the Adobe\CEP\extensions folder does not exist, you can create it.

Restart Photoshop. You’ll find the extension at Window > Extensions >

Ensure that you do not modify the extension folder. Doing so will cause a “The extension could not be loaded because it was not properly signed” error when you try to launch it.
